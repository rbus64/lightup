# Id√©e du jeu 

All art/sprites are OC. Created by the team.

Concept is based on light-up game.

To win the game, you must light up with night-lights all the dark squares, to get rid of the uncatchable monster.
A night-light can not face one another. You must respect the number of night-lights written on the walls.
The game will offer a number of tools for the player:
            | undo | redo | toggle flag | restart | help | auto - solve | save | exit |
